## Platforms

I will post shell scripts in this repository for installing Qiskit on various platforms as I revisit those platforms. Currently we have:

* s390 (This was blogged as [Using Qiskit on IBM z Systems](https://medium.com/qiskit/using-qiskit-on-ibm-z-systems-398c0c68ffad))
  * a shell script for Ubuntu as provisioned by the [IBM LinuxONE Community Cloud](https://linuxone.cloud.marist.edu/#/login)
  * a shell script for RedHat as provisioned by the [IBM LinuxONE Community Cloud](https://linuxone.cloud.marist.edu/#/login)
  * a shell script for SUSE as provisioned by the [IBM LinuxONE Community Cloud](https://linuxone.cloud.marist.edu/#/login)
  * a dockerfile for a Qiskit container in RHEL8 (contributed, not tested by me)
    * _out of date, apologies_

No guarantees, of course! Such recipes tend to quickly go out of date. [Post an issue](https://github.com/jwoehr/Quantum-Computing/issues) if you find any problems, please!
